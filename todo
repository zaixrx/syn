- make the VM stack of usizes that point to data in the chunk's constant table
- give fixed width to the possibly non dynamic data-structures

- symantic analyzer and type checker at compile-time - add un-initialized state for both globals and locals
- revisit the limits imposed on (max_locals, max_instructions_in_block, max_params)
